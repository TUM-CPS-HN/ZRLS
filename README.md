## A Short Video About the Idea
(Add link here if available)

## Problem Statement
We present a data-driven reachability analysis framework that computes **over-approximations of reachable sets directly from online state measurements**.  

The method estimates **time-varying unknown models** using an **Exponentially Forgetting Zonotopic Recursive Least Squares (EF-ZRLS)** algorithm, which processes data corrupted by bounded noise.  

Specifically:  
- A time-varying set of models that contains the true system model is estimated recursively.  
- This estimated set is then used to compute the forward reachable sets under process noise and uncertain inputs.
